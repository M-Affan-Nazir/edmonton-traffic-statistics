## Notebook Details

### `00_data_overview.ipynb`
**About:** Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the raw datasets: collision records, weekday traffic volumes, and hourly weather.
**What it accomplishes:**
- Loads raw CSVs from `data/raw/`.
- Displays heads, shapes, and null-value counts for sanity checks.
- Generates descriptive statistics and identifies duplicate rows.
- Computes and visualizes a correlation heatmap.
- Surfaces strongest field‑to‑field correlations to guide feature ideas.

### `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
**About:** Cleans and prepares the raw datasets using helper functions from `src/data/clean_data.py`.
**What it accomplishes:**
- Drops meta/high‑null columns and removes all‑null rows where applicable.
- Filters and standardizes fields for downstream use.
- Saves cleaned tables to `data/processed/` as CSVs (e.g., `traffic_collisions.csv`, `traffic_volume.csv`, `edmonton_weather.csv`).

### `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`
**About:** Builds a model‑ready table by merging cleaned collisions, traffic volume, and weather data.
**What it accomplishes:**
- Parses date‑time fields and aligns yearly spans across datasets.
- Computes yearly aggregates (e.g., average temperature, wind speed, visibility).
- Creates derived features (e.g., injury share) to capture useful signals.
- Merges features into a single dataset and saves to `data/processed/merged_features.csv`.

### `03_statistical_inference.ipynb`
**About:** Performs hypothesis tests to compare groups and conditions relevant to collisions.
**What it accomplishes:**
- Assesses normality and variance (Shapiro–Wilk, Levene).
- Compares mean collision counts across bicycle/motorcycle/pedestrian groups with Kruskal–Wallis, followed by pairwise comparisons.
- Compares midblock vs. intersection outcomes (injuries/fatalities) with Wilcoxon signed‑rank tests.
- Summarizes statistically significant differences to inform reporting.

### `04_model_prototyping.ipynb`
**About:** Explores predictive modeling for yearly collision counts.
**What it accomplishes:**
- Inspects predictor–target relationships with scatter plots, linear fits, and LOWESS smoothing.
- Notes over‑dispersion relative to Poisson and prototypes a Negative Binomial model for `Total Collisions`.
- Prepares a short list of candidate features for subsequent modeling/delivery.

## Notes
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` contains auto‑saved notebook checkpoints created by Jupyter; contents mirror the main notebooks for recovery purposes.
- All notebooks assume input files exist under `data/` as referenced above.
